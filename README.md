# Exercise Tracker

This repository houses my completed Exercise Tracker project, a part of the FreeCodeCamp Backend API Certification. The project involves creating a RESTful API to manage exercises and users, allowing users to add and track their exercises. This implementation fulfills the specified user stories and demonstrates proficiency in building a backend server with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.


This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker
