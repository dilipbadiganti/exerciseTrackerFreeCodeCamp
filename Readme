This repository houses my completed Exercise Tracker project, a part of the FreeCodeCamp Backend API Certification. The project involves creating a RESTful API to manage exercises and users, allowing users to add and track their exercises. This implementation fulfills the specified user stories and demonstrates proficiency in building a backend server with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
